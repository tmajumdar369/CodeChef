/*You are given two positive integers A and B. Find the number of pairs of positive integers (X,Y) such that 1≤X≤A, 1≤Y≤B and X+Y is even.

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers A and B.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of valid pairs.

Constraints
1≤T≤1,000
1≤A,B≤109
Subtasks
Subtask #1 (10 points): A,B≤10
Subtask #2 (10 points): A,B≤1,000
Subtask #3 (80 points): original constraints

Example Input
